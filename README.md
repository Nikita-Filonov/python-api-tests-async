## Overview

This project provides an example of **asynchronous** API testing for a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)
using Python. It leverages [async/await](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html) capabilities to handle
I/O-bound operations efficiently, reducing overall execution time when interacting with external APIs. The project
incorporates powerful libraries and best practices to ensure maintainability, readability, and efficiency.

Key technologies and methodologies used in this project include:

- [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) – A powerful and efficient **asynchronous** HTTP client for making API
  requests.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) – Used for data validation, deserialization, and serialization.
- [Pydantic Settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) – Manages test settings in a
  structured and maintainable way.
- [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) – Generates fake data for testing purposes.
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) – A full-featured and powerful testing framework in Python with async
  support through [pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).
- [JSON Schema validation](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) – Ensures contract testing by validating
  API responses against predefined schemas.
- [Allure](https://allurereport.org/) – A comprehensive test reporting framework that provides detailed and visually
  appealing reports.
- [Assertions in separate functions](./tools/assertions) – Encourages reusable and atomic test assertions.
- [API client abstraction](./clients/operations_client.py) – Encapsulates API interaction logic for better modularity
  and reusability.
- [Base API client](./clients/base_client.py) – Serves as the entry point for all HTTP calls.
- [Logging features](./tools/logger.py) – Improves test readability and debugging, especially in CI/CD environments.
- [Routing as Enum](./tools/routes.py) – Replaces raw string URLs with an enumerated routing system for better
  maintainability.
- [Pytest plugins](./fixtures) – Moves fixtures out of conftest.py to keep the test suite organized and manageable.
- [HTTPX event hooks](./clients/event_hooks.py) – Enables logging and additional features without modifying the original
  API client code.

This project targets [SampleAPIs](https://sampleapis.com/), which provides various fake API datasets for testing.
Specifically, this project works with the [FakeBank API](https://sampleapis.com/api-list/fakebank) and uses its
endpoints for testing purposes.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.11 or later
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nikita-Filonov/python-api-tests-async.git
cd python-api-tests-async
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```shell
python -m venv venv # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activate on macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # Activate on Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install --upgrade pip # Upgrade pip to the latest version
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install required dependencies
```

## Running Tests

To run API tests using pytest:

```shell
pytest -m regression --numprocesses 2 # Run regression tests in parallel
```

## Generating Allure Reports

Run tests and generate Allure results:

```shell
pytest -m regression --alluredir=allure-results
```

To serve the Allure report locally:

```shell
allure serve allure-results
```

## Running Tests in CI/CD

Tests are automatically executed in a CI/CD pipeline using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The
workflow is configured to:

- Run tests on every push and pull request to the main branch.
- Generate and upload Allure reports as artifacts.
- Publish the [Allure report](https://allurereport.org/) to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy access.

Ensure that the [gh-pages](https://github.com/Nikita-Filonov/python-api-tests-async/tree/gh-pages) branch exists in your
repository for successful deployment. If it does not exist, create it manually:

```shell
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

Then push the new branch:

```shell
git push origin gh-pages
```

To allow GitHub Actions to publish the report, enable Workflow permissions:

- Open your repository on GitHub.
- Go to Settings > Actions > General.
- Scroll down to Workflow permissions.
- Select Read and write permissions.
- Click Save.

Once set up, your tests will run automatically, and the Allure report will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Accessing Allure Reports

After a successful test run in CI/CD:

- The Allure report will be available
  at [GitHub Pages](https://nikita-filonov.github.io/python-api-tests-async/8/index.html).
- The workflow logs and artifacts can be accessed
  via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Nikita-Filonov/python-api-tests-async/actions).
- If the [*pages build and
  deployment*](https://github.com/Nikita-Filonov/python-api-tests-async/actions/runs/14155385792)
  workflow does not appear, verify your GitHub Pages settings:
    - Go to Settings > Pages.
    - Under Build and deployment, ensure the source is set to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Summary

This project serves as a reference implementation for writing clean, maintainable, and fully
asynchronous ([async/await](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html)) API tests in Python. It demonstrates
best practices such as using a dedicated asynchronous API client, structured and reusable assertions, detailed logging,
and seamless CI/CD integration with Allure reporting. The setup enables efficient I/O-bound test execution both locally
and in CI/CD environments, ensuring high-quality automated testing with minimal manual effort.
